When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I can think of two cases:
   1. When you are working on a project from multiple devices, for example the office PC, the home PC, 
    and a laptop while travelling. Having a central repository "in the cloud" will massively help with
    syncing the work.
   2. When multiple people are working on the same project. Unless they also share the project computer,
    a centralized repository is crucial to organize the different contributions.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

	We might want to start a project that is based on a remote source, but will then evolve separatedly.
	Or people might be working on the same files you are, and with automatic pulling conflicts might occur.
	In general, it's about having more control on how you organize the project.
