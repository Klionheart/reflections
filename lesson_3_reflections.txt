When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I can think of two cases:
   1. When you are working on a project from multiple devices, for example the office PC, the home PC, 
    and a laptop while travelling. Having a central repository "in the cloud" will massively help with
    syncing the work.
   2. When multiple people are working on the same project. Unless they also share the project computer,
    a centralized repository is crucial to organize the different contributions.
