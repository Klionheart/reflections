What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The hidden directory .git is created, with a bunch of subdirectories inside.
	Needs to be done so the file structure of the repository is ready to log the commits.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area defines which filea(and directories?) will be affected by a commit, and so
	we can exclude certain parts of the working directory through it.
	It allows definiting a logical connection between the files to be committed.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Even if you have modified a bunch of unrelated file, you can only add some of them to the
	staging area for a commit. This makes it possible to divide the changes into several commits
	that only change logically related files.
